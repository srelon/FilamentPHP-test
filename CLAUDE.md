# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Architecture

Monorepo with three independent services:

- `backend/` — Laravel 13 + FilamentPHP (API + Admin panel at `/admin`)
- `frontend/` — Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite (public site)
- `websocket/` — Node.js WebSocket server (ws + ioredis + pino)

All services run in Docker. The entire stack is mounted as volumes — no image rebuilds needed for code changes, only for dependency changes.

## Docker

```bash
# First run / after Dockerfile changes
docker compose up -d --build

# Normal start
make up

# Stop everything
make down

# Start Vue dev server (port 5173)
make site
```

**Container names:** `filament_app`, `filament_nginx`, `filament_db`, `filament_redis`, `filament_scheduler`, `filament_websocket`

**Ports:** все на одном порту `8000` (API `/api`, Admin `/admin`, сайт `/`), Vue dev `5173`, phpMyAdmin `8080`, WebSocket `6001`, MySQL `8101`

## Running commands in the backend container

The container WORKDIR is `/var/www` — always `cd /var/www/backend` first.

```bash
# One-off commands
docker exec -it filament_app bash -c "cd /var/www/backend && php artisan migrate"
docker exec -it filament_app bash -c "cd /var/www/backend && composer require vendor/package"

# Interactive shell
docker exec -it filament_app bash
cd /var/www/backend

# Common artisan commands
php artisan migrate
php artisan make:filament-resource ModelName --generate
php artisan make:model ModelName -mfs
php artisan tinker
```

## Shell scripts and permissions

`_docker/app/entrypoint.sh` and `scheduler-entrypoint.sh` are called via `sh script.sh` in docker-compose.yml — **do not** change this to a direct path call, as files created on Windows lose the `+x` bit. The `sh` wrapper bypasses this.

## Filament

After installing (`composer require filament/filament` inside the container):
```bash
php artisan filament:install --panels   # creates AdminPanelProvider
php artisan make:filament-user          # creates first admin user
php artisan make:filament-resource ModelName --generate
```

Filament files live in `backend/app/Filament/` (Resources, Pages, Widgets).

### RBAC

Every resource extends `BaseResource` (sets `$accessKey`) and every edit page extends `BaseEditRecord`. No separate View pages — the Edit page is used for both viewing and editing.

```
app/Filament/Resources/
    BaseResource.php      ← abstract, hasAccess() helper, all can* methods
    BaseEditRecord.php    ← abstract, hides Save + shows danger toast on unauthorized save
    Users/
        UserResource.php  ← extends BaseResource, $accessKey = 'users'
        Pages/
            ListUsers.php   ← CreateAction with ->visible(canCreate())
            CreateUser.php
            EditUser.php    ← extends BaseEditRecord, authorizeAccess() checks .view
```

- `canViewAny/canView` → requires `{key}.view`
- `canCreate/canEdit` → requires `{key}.edit`
- Form `->disabled(!static::hasAccess('edit'))` makes fields read-only for view-only users
- Never use `abort(403)` inside `beforeSave()` — use `Notification::make()->danger()->send()` + `$this->halt()` to show a toast instead of an error modal

## Shop domain (backend database)

Full table/column/status reference: **`backend/docs/database.md`** — read it before writing migrations, models, or Filament resources for these tables. Migrations: `backend/database/migrations/2026_07_02_*`. Models: `backend/app/Models/*`.

Facts that aren't obvious from the schema alone:

- **Price/stock live in `product_stocks`, not `products`.** A product can have several stock rows (batches at different prices); `status` tracks which batch is active/queued/finished. `order_items.product_stock_id` pins an order line to the exact batch it was sold from.
- **`orders.status` and `order_items.status` are independent** — one order can have some items delivered and others cancelled. Admin flow (not built yet): set `order_items.status` first, then `orders.status`, which back-fills any untouched items.
- **`product_reviews`/`product_review_likes`/`product_review_reports`/`user_notifications` are ported 1:1 from another existing project** (its `comments`/`comment_likes`/`comment_reports`/`user_notifications` tables), with `article_id → product_id`, `comment_id → review_id`. Don't redesign this structure — the moderation/notification logic behind it already works there and will be ported later.
- **`orders.public_id` and `orders.txid` are auto-generated** in `Order::booted()` (`static::creating`) — never set them manually.
- **Status convention:** across every status enum in this domain, `4` means cancelled/deleted, never `2`/`3`. Keep new statuses consistent with this.
- **Guest support differs by table.** Cart, checkout, orders all support guests (`user_id` nullable). `product_reviews` does **not** — reviews require authentication, no guest name/email fields.
- **`User::notifications()` is taken by Laravel's `Notifiable` trait** — the shop notifications relation is `User::userNotifications()`.
- **Several shop tables are prefixed `products_` for disambiguation, not their bare name** — `products_categories` (model `ProductsCategory`, vs. `news_categories`), `products_authors` (model `ProductsAuthor`), `products_favorites` (model `ProductsFavorite`). Don't reintroduce `categories`/`authors`/`favorites` as table or class names.
- **Image columns (`icon`, `image`, `photo`) are JSON, not a path string** — cast to `array`, storing size/format variants. Applies to `products_categories`, `products_authors`, `product_images`, `news_posts`.
- **SEO fields live in one shared `seo_meta` table**, not duplicated per content table — `Product::seo()`, `ProductsCategory::seo()`, `NewsPost::seo()` are `morphOne(SeoMeta::class, 'seo', 'type', 'record_id')`, with the morph map (`AppServiceProvider::boot()`) aliasing `type` to the target's table name instead of its class name.
- **Customer auth is Sanctum SPA (cookie-based)**, guard `web` / provider `users` — separate from the `admins` guard used by the Filament panel. `SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS` in `.env` must stay bare `host:port` (no scheme); `config/cors.php` derives its own scheme-prefixed origins from that same variable.
- **`php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` gives a working demo catalog** — every shop table has a seeder in `database/seeders/`, sourced from the frontend's hardcoded mock data (not invented), with the referenced images copied into `storage/app/public/{products,products_categories,news}/`. See `backend/docs/database.md` § Seed data for the two placeholder exceptions (stock quantity, delivery branch hash).

## Backend API conventions — ALWAYS follow these

**Keep `backend/docs/database.md` current.** Any migration, model, or other change to the database (new table, new column, changed status meaning, dropped field) must update that doc in the same change — it's part of the change, not a follow-up task. Never let it drift out of sync with the actual schema.

**Tests ship with the API code that needs them.** When adding or changing an API endpoint, create or update its Pest feature test in the same change — don't leave that for a later pass. If a request/response contract changes, update the existing test alongside it so it never goes stale.

**Validation lives in Form Requests, never in controllers.** One request class per resource, shared between create and update instead of two near-duplicate classes — read the route's id param inside `rules()` to adjust rules that differ between the two (e.g. `Rule::unique(...)->ignore($id)` for edit vs. plain `unique` for create).

```php
class ProductRequest extends FormRequest
{
    public function rules(): array
    {
        $id = $this->route('id');

        return [
            'title' => ['required', 'string', 'max:255'],
            'slug' => ['required', 'string', Rule::unique('products', 'slug')->ignore($id)],
        ];
    }
}
```

**No business logic in controllers.** A controller method only resolves a Request, calls a Service (`app/Services/`) or another dedicated layer (e.g. an Action), and returns the response — nothing else. All business logic belongs in the service layer.

**Response shape comes from `App\Traits\RespondTrait`** (already `use`d in the base `Controller`) — never build the JSON envelope by hand in a controller:
- `$this->respondWithJson($content, $status = 200)` → `{data, status}`
- `$this->respondWithError($message, $code = 400)` → `{status, errors}`
- `$this->paginationMeta($paginated)` → `{current_page, last_page, total, prev_page_url, next_page_url}` (the last two are `'prev'`/`'next'`/`null` flags, not real URLs)

## Frontend (Vue 3 — `frontend/`)

### Structure

```
src/
  assets/scss/        ← global styles only
    _variables.scss   ← design tokens ($color-primary, $color-accent, $color-dark, $color-danger, etc.)
    _mixins.scss      ← shared mixins (form-field-label, form-field-base, form-field-error-text)
    _reset.scss       ← Google Fonts import, base reset
    _helpers.scss     ← .container, .section, .section__title, .dots
    main.scss         ← @forward variables, @use reset/helpers
  components/
    layout/           ← AppHeader, AppFooter, Layout
    ui/base/          ← BaseButton, BaseInput, BaseSelect, BaseRadioGroup, BaseTabs, BaseSlider
    ui/shop/          ← all page-section components (PageHero, ProductCard, etc.)
    ui/cart/          ← CheckoutStep, CartPopup (shared across cart/checkout views)
  composables/        ← useCheckoutForm (localStorage-backed cart form state), useWizardStep (step draft/confirm pattern)
  views/Pages/        ← Home.vue (assembles components only, no UI logic)
  views/Pages/Cart/   ← CartPage.vue (checkout wizard) + ContactStep/DeliveryStep/PaymentStep.vue
  stores/shop.ts      ← Pinia: cart_count
  routes/router.ts    ← Vue Router history mode
public/images/        ← static images served at /images/*.png
public/favicon.svg    ← square book-logo icon, matches AppHeader logo colors
```

### SCSS rules

- Vite `additionalData` auto-injects `@use "@/assets/scss/variables" as *;` and `@use "@/assets/scss/mixins" as *;` into every component
- **Never redeclare `$color-*` variables inside component `<style>`** — they come from global injection
- Form-field components (`BaseInput`, `BaseSelect`) share label/field/error styling via `@include form-field-label`, `@include form-field-base`, `@include form-field-error-text` from `_mixins.scss` — don't re-declare padding/border/focus styles per component
- `_reset.scss` and `_helpers.scss` each start with `@use 'variables' as *;` to access variables; `main.scss` pulls them together with `@forward 'variables'; @use 'reset'; @use 'helpers';`
- All component styles: `<style lang="scss" scoped>` with BEM naming

### Component rules

- All reusable components in `src/components/ui/` — never tie components to a specific page
- `ui/base/` — generic (BaseButton, BaseInput, BaseTabs, BaseSlider)
- `ui/shop/` — shop-specific but still reusable (ProductCard, ProductSlider, PageHero, etc.)
- Views (`views/`) only assemble components — no inline styles, no UI logic
- Static images referenced in JS data → `public/images/` (Vite can't resolve dynamic `src/assets` paths)

### BaseSlider

Single slider component used by PageHero and ProductSlider. Never duplicate slider logic.

```ts
// Props
count: number          // total slides/pages
dot_style: 'rect' | 'diamond' | 'circle'
auto_play_ms: number   // 0 = disabled; PageHero uses 30000
model_value?: number   // optional v-model for parent to track active index

// Slot
#default="{ active }"  // scoped slot, active = current index
```

Handles: drag/swipe (threshold 30px), auto-play, dot clicks, v-model sync.

### Key design decisions

**Book store (current project):**
- **HomeHero** — `hero__top` (grid 1fr 1fr: H1 left, desc right) + `hero__bottom` (grid 2fr 1fr 1fr, min-height 500px); image cards with gradient overlay + newsletter block in mid column
- **AppHeader** — book SVG logo + "BookStore" text; Categories mega-menu is a separate element LEFT of Home nav link, controlled by `cats_open` ref + mouseenter/mouseleave on wrapper
- **CategoryStrip** — CSS carousel (transform translateX), shows 8 items, auto-advances every 10s; reset without jump uses double `requestAnimationFrame` to skip transition for one frame
- **ProductCard** — extracted reusable component; hover slides action icons in from right (`translateX(60px) → 0`); `aspect-ratio: 2/3` on figure
- **BestAuthorSection** — award badges are 72px circles with `border: 2px solid $color-primary` and text inside — NO SVG icons
- **BestsellersSection** — title and description configurable via props with defaults

**SVG fill in scoped styles** — CSS `fill` on `<svg>` does not reliably cascade to `<path>` in Vue scoped CSS. Always target child elements directly:
```scss
&__icon {
    path, circle { fill: $color-primary; }
}
```

**Card overlays** — always use `position: absolute; inset: 0` on the overlay, never `position: relative; height: 100%` — the latter collapses when the parent gets its height from flex.

**Checkout wizard (`views/Pages/Cart/CartPage.vue`)** — 3-step flow (Contact → Delivery → Payment) via `CheckoutStep.vue` wrapper (`step_number`, `active`, `done`, `#default`/`#summary` slots, emits `edit`).
- `useCheckoutForm()` holds the three step data refs, persisted to `localStorage`.
- Each step component takes `initial_data` prop, emits `change` (live draft, drives the sidebar `#summary` slot) and `complete` (fires only on explicit "Continue" click, advances `current_step` in `CartPage.vue`).
- `ContactStep.vue` uses vee-validate (`useForm`/`useField`, matches `ContactForm.vue` pattern) — **not** part of `useWizardStep`.
- `DeliveryStep.vue`/`PaymentStep.vue` use the `useWizardStep<T>(initial_data, emit, validator?)` composable instead (plain `reactive` draft + `is_valid` + `on_continue`) — do not hand-roll this pattern again, only these two non-vee-validate steps need it.
- Radio-style method pickers (delivery method, payment method) → `ui/base/BaseRadioGroup.vue` (generic `<script setup generic="T extends string">` component) — never re-duplicate the label/input markup or `__method`/`__method--active` styles per step.
- `BaseButton` has a third `variant="text"` (no background/border, small font, color-only hover) for inline actions like "Edit"/"Edit Items" — use it instead of ad-hoc `<button>` + custom SCSS.

## Environment

Root `.env` controls Docker (ports, MySQL credentials). Backend has its own `backend/.env` for Laravel (DB_HOST=`db`, REDIS_HOST=`redis`).

## Real-time

Redis pub/sub connects backend to websocket server. PHP publishes to Redis → `websocket/server.js` subscribes and broadcasts to connected clients via ws.

## Code Style Rules — ALWAYS follow these

**NO alignment spaces.** Single space before `=`, `=>`, `:` — never pad to align columns. This applies to code only (PHP/TS/Vue) — in Markdown docs, alignment/padding for readability (e.g. lining up `|` columns in a table) is fine, since it isn't code.

```php
// WRONG
$output   = trim(...);
'title'   => $this->title,

// RIGHT
$output = trim(...);
'title' => $this->title,
```

```ts
// WRONG
const is_loading   = ref(true)
const page_title   = ref('')

// RIGHT
const is_loading = ref(true)
const page_title = ref('')
```

**NO objects/arrays on one line.** Every property on its own line, always — no exceptions, even for short objects.

```ts
// WRONG
{ name: 'name', model: null, placeholder: 'Name', type: 'text' },
{ key: 'id', text: 'ID' },

// RIGHT
{
    name: 'name',
    model: null,
    placeholder: 'Name',
    type: 'text',
},
{
    key: 'id',
    text: 'ID',
},
...(condition ? [{
    key: 'actions',
    text: '',
}] : []),
```

**snake_case** for all variables, object keys, props, interface fields. camelCase/PascalCase only for functions, components, file names.

**English only** — all code comments, docblocks, and inline notes must be in English. This also applies to every documentation file in the repo (README, `docs/*.md`, CLAUDE.md itself) — nothing checked into the repo should be in a non-English language, regardless of what language is used to address Claude in conversation.

**No explanatory/rationale comments in code, even for non-obvious decisions.** Context about *why* something was built a certain way belongs in `backend/docs/database.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, not in a `//` line next to the code — an inline comment almost always just duplicates what's already documented there. If a decision is worth flagging, say it in the chat reply so it can be routed to docs deliberately, not left as a stray comment.

## Validation — ALWAYS use vee-validate + yup

All form validation in the frontend must use **vee-validate** with **yup** schemas. Never write manual validation logic (custom `computed` flags like `field !== ''`, manual error refs, etc.).

Pattern (matches `ContactForm.vue`):
- `useForm({ validationSchema: object({...}) })` at the component or page level
- Field components use `useField(() => props.name)` internally (like `BaseInput.vue`)
- Schema built with `yup`: use `.min(1, 'message')` for required text fields — **never** `string().required()` alone, because yup v1 passes `''` (empty string) through `required()`. Only `min(1)` reliably catches empty string. For email: `.min(1, '...').email('...')`. For numbers/phones: `.min(N, '...')`.
- Submit fires only when schema is valid (`handleSubmit` from `useForm`)
- Validation messages in Russian
